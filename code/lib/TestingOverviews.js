Integration testing is conducted to evaluate the compliance of a system or component with specified functional requirements. It occurs after unit testing and before validation testing. Integration testing takes as its input modules that have been unit tested, groups them in larger aggregates, applies tests defined in an integration test plan to those aggregates, and delivers as its output the integrated system ready for system testing."

The purpose of integration testing is to detect any inconsistencies between the units that are integrated together (called assemblages). System testing seeks to detect defects both within the \"inter-assemblages\" and also within the system as a whole. The actual result is the behavior produced or observed when a component or system is tested.System testing is performed on the entire system in the context of either functional requirement specifications (FRS) or system requirement specification (SRS), or both. System testing tests not only the design, but also the behaviour and even the believed expectations of the customer. It is also intended to test up to and beyond the bounds defined in the software or hardware requirements specification(s).\n\n"

                "title": "Operational acceptance testing",
                "extract": "Operational acceptance testing (OAT) is  used to conduct operational readiness (pre-release) of a product, service, or system as part of a quality management system. OAT is a common type of non-functional software testing, used mainly in software development and software maintenance projects. This type of testing focuses on the operational readiness of the system to be supported, and/or to become part of the production environment. Hence, it is also known as operational readiness testing (ORT) or operations readiness and assurance testing (OR&A). Functional testing within OAT is limited to those tests which are required to verify the non-functional aspects of the system.\nAccording to the International Software Testing Qualifications Board (ISTQB), OAT may include checking the backup/restore facilities, IT disaster recovery procedures, maintenance tasks and periodic check of security vulnerabilities., and whitepapers on ISO 29119 and Operational Acceptance by Anthony Woods, and ISO 25000 and Operational Acceptance Testing by Dirk Dach et al., OAT generally includes:\nComponent Testing\nFailover (Within the same data centre)Component fail-over\nNetwork fail-overFunctional StabilityAccessibility\nConversion\nStability\nUsabilityIT Service Management (Supportability)\nMonitoring and Alerts (to ensure proper alerts are configured in the system if something goes wrong)\nPortabilityCompatibility\nInteroperability\nInstallation and Backout\nLocalizationRecovery (across data centres)Application/system recovery\nData recoveryReliabilityBackup and Restoration (Recovery)\nDisaster Recovery\nMaintainability\nPerformance, Stress and Volume,\nProcedures (Operability) and Supporting Documentation (Supportability)\nSecurity and PenetrationDuring OAT changes may be made to environmental parameters which the application uses to run smoothly. For example, with Microsoft Windows applications with a mixed or hybrid architecture, this may include: Windows services, configuration files, web services, XML files, COM+ components, web services, IIS, stored procedures in databases, etc. Typically OAT should occur after each main phase of the development life cycle: design, build, and functional testing. In sequential projects it is often viewed as a final verification before a system is released; where in agile and iterative projects, a more frequent execution of OAT occurs providing stakeholders with assurance of continued stability of the system and its operating environment.\nAn approach used in OAT may follow these steps:\n\nDesign the system,\nAssess the design,\nBuild the system,\nConfirm if built to design,\nEvaluate the system addresses business functional requirements,\nAssess the system for compliance with non-functional requirements,\nDeploy the system,\nAssess operability and supportability of the system.For running the OAT test cases, the tester normally has exclusive access to the system or environment. This means that a single tester would be executing the test cases at a single point of time. For OAT the exact Operational Readiness quality gates are defined: both entry and exit gates. The primary emphasis of OAT should be on the operational stability, portability and reliability of the system."
